# Mil Map

Problem: I would like to be able to generate my own military maps for a given area at a given zoom level because the military maps that I'm issued are frequently either too zoomed out or too old.

Solution: I'd like to use the openstreetmaps data to generate a map that can serve as a military use map.

other notes:

- I'd like the solution to be written in dotnet
- Military maps use the MGRS (military grid reference system)
- I would like the map to IDEALLY be 1:25000 or even 1:10000 scale
- I would like to be able to pass in a MGRS grid boundary, or a region latitude, or a military installation, and be able to get the map for it
